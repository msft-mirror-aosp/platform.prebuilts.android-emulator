Deployment Platforms, and

(ii) grant sublicenses to Redistributables, as distributed hereunder, for
Customers solely for Customer's internal use and to the extent necessary in
order for the Customers to use the Applications for their respective intended
purposes.

Right to distribute the Redistributables as part of an Application as provided
herein is not royalty-bearing but is conditional upon the Licensee having paid
the agreed Development Licenses from The Qt Company before distributing any
Redistributables to Customers.

3.3 Distribution of Devices

Subject to the terms of this Agreement, The Qt Company grants to Licensee a
personal, worldwide, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable (for cause
pursuant to this Agreement) right and license, valid for the Term, to

The licenses granted above in this Section 3 by The Qt Company to Licensee are
conditional and subject to Licensee's compliance with the following terms:

(i) Licensee shall not remove or alter any copyright, trademark or other
proprietary rights notice contained in any portion of the Licensed Software;

(ii) Applications must add primary and substantial functionality to the
Licensed Software;

(iii) Applications may not pass on functionality which in any way makes it
possible for others to create software with the Licensed Software; provided
however that Licensee may use the Licensed Software's scripting and QML ("Qt
Quick") functionality solely in order to enable scripting, themes and styles
that augment the functionality and appearance of the Application(s) without
adding primary and substantial functionality to the Application(s);

(iv) Applications must not compete with the Licensed Software;

(v) Licensee shall not use The Qt Company's or any of its suppliers' names,
logos, or trademarks to market Applications, except that Licensee may use
"Built with Qt" logo to indicate that Application(s) was developed using the
Licensed Software;

(vi) Licensee shall not distribute, sublicense or disclose source code of
Licensed Software to any third party (provided however that Licensee may
appoint employee(s) of Contractors as Designated Users to use Licensed
Software pursuant to this Agreement). Such right may be available for the
Licensee subject to a separate software development kit ("SDK") license
agreement to be concluded with The Qt Company;

(vii) Licensee shall not grant the Customers a right to (i) make copies of the
Redistributables except when and to the extent required to use the Applications
and/or Devices for their intended purpose, (ii) modify the Redistributables or

with, or use Licensed Software for creation of, any software created with or
incorporating Open Source Qt, or b) incorporate or integrate Applications
into a hardware device or product other than a Device, unless Licensee has
received an advance written permission from The Qt Company to do so. Absent
such written permission, any and all distribution by the Licensee during the
Term of a hardware device or product a) which incorporate or integrate any
part of Licensed Software or Open Source Qt; or b) where the main user
interface or substantial functionality is provided by software build with
Licensed Software or Open Source Qt or otherwise depends on the Licensed
Software or Open Source Qt, shall be considered as a Device distribution under
this Agreement and dependent on compliance thereof (including but not limited
to obligation to pay applicable License Fees for such distribution);

(ix) Licensee shall cause all of its Affiliates and Contractors entitled to
make use of the licenses granted under this Agreement, to be contractually
bound to comply with the relevant terms of this Agreement and not to use the
Licensed Software beyond the terms hereof and for any purposes other than
operating within the scope of their services for Licensee. Licensee shall be
responsible for any and all actions and omissions of its Affiliates and
Contractors relating to the Licensed Software and use thereof (including but
not limited to payment of all applicable License Fees);

(x) Except when and to the extent explicitly provided in this Section 3,
Licensee shall not transfer, publish, disclose, display or otherwise make
available the Licensed Software;

; and

(xi) Licensee shall not attempt or enlist a third party to conduct or attempt
to conduct any of the above.

Above terms shall not be applicable if and to the extent they conflict with any
mandatory provisions of any applicable laws.

Any use of Licensed Software beyond the provisions of this Agreement is
strictly prohibited and requires an additional license from The Qt Company.

4. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE

The Licensed Software may provide links to third party libraries or code
(collectively "Third Party Software") to implement various functions. Third
Party Software does not comprise part of the Licensed Software. In some cases,
access to Third Party Software may be included in the Licensed Software. Such
Third Party Software will be listed in the ".../src/3rdparty" source tree
delivered with the Licensed Software or documented in the Licensed Software, as
such may be amended from time to time. Licensee acknowledges that use or
distribution of Third Party Software is in all respects subject to applicable
license terms of applicable third party right holders.

5. PRE-RELEASE CODE

The Licensed Software may contain pre-release code and functionality marked or
otherwise stated as "Technology Preview", "Alpha", "Beta" or similar
designation. Such pre-release code may be present in order to provide
experimental support for new platforms or preliminary versions of one or more
new functionalities. The pre-release code may not be at the level of
performance and compatibility of a final, generally available, product
offering of the Licensed Software. The pre-release parts of the Licensed
Software may not operate correctly, may contain errors and may be substantially
modified by The Qt Company prior to the first commercial product release, if
any. The Qt Company is under no obligation to make pre-release code
commercially available, or provide any Support or Updates relating thereto. The
Qt Company assumes no liability whatsoever regarding any pre-release code, but
any use thereof is exclusively at Licensee's own risk and expense.

6. LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

The Qt Company hereby represents and warrants that it has the power and
authority to grant the rights and licenses granted to Licensee under this
Agreement.

Except as set forth above, the Licensed Software is licensed to Licensee
"as is" and Licensee's exclusive remedy and The Qt Company's entire liability
for errors in the Licensed Software shall be limited, at The Qt Company's
option, to correction of the error, replacement of the Licensed Software or
return of the applicable fees paid for the defective Licensed Software for the
time period during which the License is not able to utilize the Licensed
Software under the terms of this Agreement.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE QT COMPANY ON BEHALF OF
ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS, SUPPLIERS AND AFFILIATES, DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY IMPLIED
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-
INFRINGEMENT WITH REGARD TO THE LICENSED SOFTWARE. THE QT COMPANY DOES NOT
WARRANT THAT THE LICENSED SOFTWARE WILL SATISFY LICENSEE'S REQUIREMENTS OR THAT
IT WILL OPERATE WITHOUT DEFECT OR ERROR OR THAT THE OPERATION THEREOF WILL BE
UNINTERRUPTED. ALL USE OF AND RELIANCE ON THE LICENSED SOFTWARE IS AT THE SOLE
RISK OF AND RESPONSIBILITY OF LICENSEE.

7. INDEMNIFICATION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

7.1 Limitation of Liability

EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II)
BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO
EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFIT,
LOSS OF DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR GOODWILL OR ANY OTHER INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE COST, DAMAGES OR EXPENSE OF ANY KIND,
HOWSOEVER ARISING UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT. PARTIES
SPECIFICALLY AGREE THAT LICENSEE'S OBLIGATION TO PAY LICENSE AND OTHER FEES
CORRESPONDING TO ACTUAL USAGE OF LICENSED SOFTWARE HEREUNDER SHALL BE
CONSIDERED AS A DIRECT DAMAGE.

EXCEPT FOR (I) CASES OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR INTENTIONAL MISCONDUCT,  AND (II)
BREACH OF CONFIDENTIALITY, AND TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN
NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY'S TOTAL AGGREGATE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
EXCEED THE AGGREGATE LICENSE FEES PAID OR PAYABLE TO THE QT COMPANY FROM
LICENSEE DURING THE PERIOD OF TWELVE (12) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE
EVENT RESULTING IN SUCH LIABILITY.

THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 7 ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT
BETWEEN THE QT COMPANY AND LICENSEE AND THE PARTIES HAVE RELIED UPON THE
LIMITATIONS SET FORTH HEREIN IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.

7.2 Licensee's Indemnification

Licensee shall indemnify and hold harmless The Qt Company from and against any
claim, injury, judgment, settlement, loss or expense, including attorneys' fees
related to: (a) Licensee's misrepresentation in connection with The Qt Company
or the Licensed Software or breach of this Agreement, (b) the Application or
Device (except where such cause of liability is solely attributable to the
Licensed Software).

8. SUPPORT, UPDATES AND ONLINE SERVICES

Upon due payment of the agreed License Fees the Licensee will be eligible to
receive Support and Updates and to use the Online Services during the License
Term, provided, however, that in the event the License Term is longer than 36
months, Support is provided only for the first 12 months, unless the Parties
specifically otherwise agree.

Unless otherwise decided by The Company at its free and absolute discretion,
Upgrades will not be included in the Support but may be available subject to
additional fees.

From time to time The Qt Company may change the Support terms, provided that
during the respective ongoing License Term the level of Support provided by The
Qt Company may not be reduced without the consent of the Licensee.

Unless otherwise agreed, The Qt Company shall not be responsible for providing
any service or support to Customers.

9. CONFIDENTIALITY

Each Party acknowledges that during the Term of this Agreement each Party may
receive information about the other Party's business, business methods,
business plans, customers, business relations, technology, and other
information, including the terms of this Agreement, that is confidential and
of great value to the other Party, and the value of which would be
significantly reduced if disclosed to third parties ("Confidential
Information"). Accordingly, when a Party (the "Receiving Party") receives
Confidential Information from the other Party (the "Disclosing Party"), the
Receiving Party shall only disclose such information to employees and
Contractors on a need to know basis, and shall cause its employees and
employees of its Affiliates to: (i) maintain any and all Confidential
Information in confidence; (ii) not disclose the Confidential Information to a
third party without the Disclosing Party's prior written approval; and (iii)
not, directly or indirectly, use the Confidential Information for any purpose
other than for exercising its rights and fulfilling its responsibilities
pursuant to this Agreement. Each Party shall take reasonable measures to
protect the Confidential Information of the other Party, which measures shall
not be less than the measures taken by such Party to protect its own
confidential and proprietary information.

Obligation of confidentiality shall not apply to information that (i) is or
becomes generally known to the public through no act or omission of the
Receiving Party; (ii) was in the Receiving Party's lawful possession prior to
the disclosure hereunder and was not subject to limitations on disclosure or
use; (iii) is developed independently by employees or Contractors of the
Receiving Party or other persons working for the Receiving Party who have not
had access to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, as proven
by the written records of the Receiving Party; (iv) is lawfully disclosed to
the Receiving Party without restrictions, by a third party not under an
obligation of confidentiality; or (v) the Receiving Party is legally compelled
to disclose, in which case the Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing
Party of such compelled disclosure and assert the privileged and confidential
nature of the information and cooperate fully with the Disclosing Party to
limit the scope of disclosure and the dissemination of disclosed Confidential
Information to the minimum extent necessary.

The obligations under this Section 9 shall continue to remain in force for a
period of five (5) years after the last disclosure, and, with respect to trade
secrets, for so long as such trade secrets are protected under applicable trade
secret laws.

10. FEES, DELIVERY AND PAYMENT

10.1 License Fees

License Fees are described in The Qt Company's standard price list, quote or
Purchase Order confirmation or in an appendix hereto, as the case may be.

The License Fees shall not be refunded or claimed as a credit in any event or
for any reason whatsoever.

10.2 Ordering Licenses

Licensee may purchase Development Licenses and Distribution Licenses pursuant
to agreed pricing terms or, if no specific pricing terms have been agreed upon,
at The Qt Company's standard pricing terms applicable at the time of purchase.

Licensee shall submit all purchase orders for Development Licenses and
Distribution Licenses to The Qt Company by email or any other method acceptable
to The Qt Company (each such order is referred to herein as a "Purchase Order")
for confirmation, whereupon the Purchase Order shall become binding between the
Parties.

10.3 Distribution License Packs

Unless otherwise agreed, Distribution Licenses shall be purchased by way of
Distribution License Packs.

Upon due payment of the ordered Distribution License Pack(s), the Licensee will
have an account of Distribution Licenses available for installing, bundling or
integrating (all jointly "installing") the Redistributables with the Devices or
for otherwise distributing the Redistributables in accordance with this
Agreement.

Each time Licensee "installs" or distributes a copy of Redistributables, then
one Distribution License is used, and Licensee's account of available
Distribution Licenses is decreased accordingly.

Licensee may "install" copies of the Redistributables so long as Licensee has
Distribution Licenses remaining on its account.

Redistributables will be deemed to have been "installed" into a Device when one
of the following circumstances shall have occurred: a) the Redistributables
have been loaded onto the Device and used outside of the Licensee's premises or
b) the Device has been fully tested and placed into Licensee's inventory
(or sold) for the first time (i.e., Licensee will not be required to use
(or pay for) more than one Distribution License for each individual Device,
e.g. in a situation where a Device is returned to Licensee's inventory after
delivery to a distributor or sale to a Customer). In addition, if Licensee
includes a back-up copy of the Redistributables on a CD-ROM or other storage
medium along with the product, that backup copy of the Redistributables will
not be deemed to have been "installed" and will not require an additional
Distribution License.

10.4 Payment Terms

License Fees and any other charges under this Agreement shall be paid by
Licensee no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the applicable invoice
from The Qt Company.

The Qt Company will submit an invoice to Licensee after the date of this
Agreement and/or after The Qt Company receives a Purchase Order from
Licensee.

A late payment charge of the lower of (a) one percent per month; or (b) the
interest rate stipulated by applicable law, shall be charged on any unpaid
balances that remain past due.

The Qt Company shall have the right to suspend, terminate or withhold grants
of all rights to the Licensed Software hereunder, including but not limited to
the Developer License, Distribution License, and Support, should Licensee fail
to make payment in timely fashion.

10.5 Taxes

All License Fees and other charges payable hereunder are gross amounts but
exclusive of any value added tax, use tax, sales tax and other taxes, duties or
tariffs ("Taxes"). Such applicable Taxes shall be paid by Licensee, or, where
applicable, in lieu of payment of such Taxes, Licensee shall provide an
exemption certificate to The Qt Company and any applicable authority.

11 RECORD-KEEPING AND REPORTING OBLIGATIONS; AUDIT RIGHTS

11.1 Licensee's Record-keeping

Licensee shall at all times maintain accurate and up-to-date written records of
Licensee's activities related to the use of Licensed Software and distribution
of Redistributables. The records shall be adequate to determine Licensee's
compliance with the provisions of this Agreement and to demonstrate the number
of Designated Users and Redistributables distributed by Licensee. The records
shall conform to good accounting practices reasonably acceptable to The Qt
Company.

Licensee shall, within thirty (30) days from receiving The Qt Company's request
to that effect, deliver to The Qt Company a report on Licensee's usage of
Licensed Software, such report to copies of Redistributables distributed by
Licensee during that calendar quarter, and also detailing the number of
undistributed copies of Redistributables made by Licensee and remaining in its
account contain information, in sufficient detail, on (i) amount of users
working with Licensed Software, (ii) copies of Redistributables distributed by
Licensee during that calendar quarter, (iii) number of undistributed copies of
Redistributables and corresponding number of unused Distribution Licenses
remaining on Licensee's account, and (iv) any other information as The Qt
Company may reasonably require from time to time.

11.2. The Qt Company's Audit Rights

The Qt Company or an independent auditor acting on behalf of The Qt Company's,
may, upon at least five (5) business days' prior written notice and at its
expense, audit Licensee with respect to the use of the Redistributables, but
not more frequently than once during each 6-month period. Such audit may be
conducted by mail, electronic means or through an in-person visit to Licensee's
place of business. Any such in-person audit shall be conducted during regular
business hours at Licensee's facilities and shall not unreasonably interfere
with Licensee's business activities. The Qt Company or the independent auditor
acting on behalf of The Qt Company shall be entitled to inspect Licensee's
Records. All such Licensee's Records and use thereof shall be subject to an
obligation of confidentiality under this Agreement.

If an audit reveals that Licensee is using the Licensed Software beyond scope
of the licenses Licensee has paid for, Licensee agrees to immediately pay The
Qt Company any amounts owed for such unauthorized use.

In addition, in the event the audit reveals a material violation of the terms
of this Agreement (underpayment of more than 5% of License Fees shall always be
deemed a material violation for purposes of this section), then the Licensee
shall pay The Qt Company's reasonable cost of conducting such audit.

12 TERM AND TERMINATION

12.1 Term

This Agreement shall enter into force upon due acceptance by both Parties and
remain in force for as long as there is any Development License(s) in force
("Term"), unless and until terminated pursuant to the terms of this Section 12.

substantial part of its assets, ceases to conduct business, or an act
equivalent to any of the above occurs under the laws of the jurisdiction of the
other Party.

12.4 Parties' Rights and Duties upon Termination

Upon expiry or termination of the Agreement Licensee shall cease and shall
cause all Designated Users (including those of its Affiliates' and
Contractors') to cease using the Licensed Software and distribution of the
Redistributables under this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the above, in the event the Agreement expires or is terminated:

(i) as a result of The Qt Company choosing not to renew the Development
License(s) as set forth in Section 3.1, then all valid licenses possessed by
the Licensee at such date shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the
terms of this Agreement and Licensee is entitled to purchase additional
licenses as set forth in Section 10.2; or

(ii) for reason other than by The Qt Company pursuant to item (i) above or
pursuant to Section 12.2, then the Licensee is entitled, for a period of six
(6) months after the effective date of termination, to continue distribution of
Devices under the Distribution Licenses paid but unused at such effective date
of termination.

Upon any such termination the Licensee shall destroy or return to The Qt
Company all copies of the Licensed Software and all related materials and will
certify the same to The Qt Company upon its request, provided however that
Licensee may retain and exploit such copies of the Licensed Software as it may
reasonably require in providing continued support to Customers.

Expiry or termination of this Agreement for any reason whatsoever shall not
relieve Licensee of its obligation to pay any License Fees accrued or payable
to The Qt Company prior to the effective date of termination, and Licensee
shall immediately pay to The Qt Company all such fees upon the effective date
of termination.  Termination of this Agreement shall not affect any rights of
Customers to continue use of Applications and Devices (and therein incorporated
Redistributables).

12.5 Extension in case of bankruptcy

In the event The Qt Company is declared bankrupt under a final, non-cancellable
decision by relevant court of law, and this Agreement is not, at the date of
expiry of the Development License(s) pursuant to Section 3.1, assigned to
party, who has assumed The Qt Company's position as a legitimate licensor of
Licensed Software under this Agreement, then all valid licenses possessed by
the Licensee at such date of expiry, and which the Licensee has not notified
for expiry, shall be extended to be valid in perpetuity under the terms of
this Agreement.

13. GOVERNING LAW AND LEGAL VENUE

Agreement to arbitrate, shall be determined by arbitration in San Francisco,
USA, before one arbitrator. The arbitration shall be administered by JAMS
pursuant to JAMS' Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. Judgment on the

Additional IP Rights Grant (Patents)
------------------------------------

"These implementations" means the copyrightable works that implement the WebM
codecs distributed by Google as part of the WebM Project.

Google hereby grants to you a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to
make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, transfer, and otherwise
run, modify and propagate the contents of these implementations of WebM, where
such license applies only to those patent claims, both currently owned by
Google and acquired in the future, licensable by Google that are necessarily
infringed by these implementations of WebM. This grant does not include claims
that would be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of these
implementations. If you or your agent or exclusive licensee institute or order
or agree to the institution of patent litigation or any other patent
enforcement activity against any entity (including a cross-claim or
counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that any of these implementations of WebM
or any code incorporated within any of these implementations of WebM
constitute direct or contributory patent infringement, or inducement of
patent infringement, then any patent rights granted to you under this License
for these implementations of WebM shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

The notices is included for the library/exectuables: boringssl

===========================================================
BoringSSL is a fork of OpenSSL. As such, large parts of it fall under OpenSSL
licensing. Files that are completely new have a Google copyright and an ISC
license. This license is reproduced at the bottom of this file.

Contributors to BoringSSL are required to follow the CLA rules for Chromium:
https://cla.developers.google.com/clas

Files in third_party/ have their own licenses, as described therein. The MIT
license, for third_party/fiat, which, unlike other third_party directories, is
compiled into non-test libraries, is included below.

The OpenSSL toolkit stays under a dual license, i.e. both the conditions of the
OpenSSL License and the original SSLeay license apply to the toolkit. See below
for the actual license texts. Actually both licenses are BSD-style Open Source
licenses. In case of any license issues related to OpenSSL please contact
openssl-core@openssl.org.

The following are Google-internal bug numbers where explicit permission from
some authors is recorded for use of their work. (This is purely for our own
record keeping.)

TRADEMARK:

The name "libpng" has not been registered by the Copyright owner
as a trademark in any jurisdiction.  However, because libpng has
been distributed and maintained world-wide, continually since 1995,
the Copyright owner claims "common-law trademark protection" in any
jurisdiction where common-law trademark is recognized.

OSI CERTIFICATION:

Libpng is OSI Certified Open Source Software.  OSI Certified Open Source is
a certification mark of the Open Source Initiative. OSI has not addressed
the additional disclaimers inserted at version 1.0.7.

EXPORT CONTROL:

The Copyright owner believes that the Export Control Classification
Number (ECCN) for libpng is EAR99, which means not subject to export
controls or International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) because
it is open source, publicly available software, that does not contain
any encryption software.  See the EAR, paragraphs 734.3(b)(3) and
734.7(b).

The following points clarify the QEMU license:

1) QEMU as a whole is released under the GNU General Public License,
version 2.

2) Parts of QEMU have specific licenses which are compatible with the
GNU General Public License, version 2. Hence each source file contains
its own licensing information.  Source files with no licensing information
are released under the GNU General Public License, version 2 or (at your
option) any later version.

As of July 2013, contributions under version 2 of the GNU General Public
License (and no later version) are only accepted for the following files
or directories: bsd-user/, linux-user/, hw/vfio/, hw/xen/xen_pt*.

3) The Tiny Code Generator (TCG) is released under the BSD license
   (see license headers in files).

4) QEMU is a trademark of Fabrice Bellard.

The notices is included for the library/exectuables: lz4

===========================================================
This repository uses 2 different licenses :
- all files in the `lib` directory use a BSD 2-Clause license
- all other files use a GPLv2 license, unless explicitly stated otherwise

Relevant license is reminded at the top of each source file,
and with presence of COPYING or LICENSE file in associated directories.

This model is selected to emphasize that
files in the `lib` directory are designed to be included into 3rd party applications,
while all other files, in `programs`, `tests` or `examples`,
receive more limited attention and support for such scenario.
